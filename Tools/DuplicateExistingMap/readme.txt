Step 1.  Upload the Map
Upload the SVG for the new map. It needs to have all the same bonuses and territories as the original at this point as this makes a 1:1 copy.

Step 2. New Map Id
Open the map in the map designer, and get the link for sharing from the side.
Inside there you will have two links. We want to look at the public link.
"Public link for sharing this map with other players: (they can't play it until it's public, but they can see it):"

In the text box it provides there is a link with a series of numbers at the end:
www.warzone.com/SinglePlayer?PreviewMap=108468

Make a note of the numbers at the end. This is your New Map Id

Step 3. Create Old Map Lobby
Create a multiplayer game using your old map. All other settings are not important.
I personally recommend creating it with a code invite as that lets you create the lobby with one person.
The game doesn't need to have started for the map duper to work. Merely the lobby must exist.

Step 4. Old Map Game Id
Your url when in this lobby will look like:
www.warzone.com/MultiPlayer?GameID=42422096

Make a note of the numbers at the end. This is your Old Map Game Id

Step 5. Email
Grab your email from https://www.warzone.com/MyAccount if you don't know it.
This is your Email

Step 6. Api Key
Visit the following link while logged in:
https://www.warzone.com/API/GetAPIToken

It will provide you with a json response.
Inside that response will be a field for the APIToken. Make a note of the value it provides.
It will look something like:   "$z8RMaH0*$tF!q2WELoVu7^9cpBnKsGyZm4"

This is your Api Key

Step 7. Map Duping Time
Run the map duper and input all of the previously noted fields into it
